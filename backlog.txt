how to make fields in the form "readonly" so that form template can render them as readonly?
concerns: this concerns only output, but does concern both "empty form" and "filled form"

///
form-edit
  - change password
  - change name (not login)
  - change roles

form-new
  - current form 

own type arguments for page or some other solution?

move away from annotations to typed fields like Editable, Readonly, Hidden, Email etc (can these compose?)

///

later

subresources, how would you do this?

use <dialog> instead of custom div

normal login-resource crud page


users/logins
  - add/edit/remove logins for a single user

backlog

- todo transactions on service level, create users service which creates user and login in single transaction across two repositories
- email service integration 
- zio http upgrade
